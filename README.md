# Finite Fluids Control (Minecraft mod for Fabric Loader)

FFC allow to control water and other fluid finite/infinite state.

In vanilla Minecraft, when a water block is next to at least two source blocks, it becomes a source
block itself, which allows collection of infinite water. This mod allows you to configure which
fluids have this behavior.

For multiplayer, you only need to install on the server-side, no client-side installation is 
required.

Default Configuration:

- Water is infinite inside oceans, rivers, swamps and beaches (below level 63).
- Lava is infinite in the nether (below level 32).

### Incompatible mods
- InstantLava
